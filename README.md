   print(os.listdir('.'))
   ```

5. **Support for Multiple Paradigms**: Python supports different programming approaches, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
   ```python
  
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python runs on many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more, making it a highly versatile tool for development across platforms.

7. **Community and Ecosystem**: Python has a large and active community, which contributes to a wealth of third-party libraries and frameworks. This ecosystem makes it easier to find resources, support, and pre-built tools for almost any task.

### Use Cases Where Python is Particularly Effective

1. **Web Development**: Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build robust, scalable web applications.
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run()
   ```

2. **Data Science and Machine Learning**: Libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch make Python a popular choice for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   print(data.head())
   ```

3. **Scripting and Automation**: Python is often used for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
   ```python
   import os
   import shutil

   source = '/path/to/source'
   destination = '/path/to/destination'

   for filename in os.listdir(source):
       shutil.copy(os.path.join(source, filename), destination)
   ```

4. Software Development: Python is used in various software development scenarios, including desktop applications, games, and system automation tools.
   ```python
   import tkinter as tk

   root = tk.Tk()
   root.title("Simple GUI")

   label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
   label.pack()

   root.mainloop()
   
5. **Scientific Computing**: With libraries like SciPy and SymPy, Python is well-suited for scientific and engineering applications.
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
   c = a + b
   print(c)
   ```

6. **Cybersecurity**: Python is used to develop security tools, perform penetration testing, and analyze malware.
   ```python
   import socket

   def get_ip(domain):
       return socket.gethostbyname(domain)

   print(get_ip('example.com'))

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
     Ans : Program :
      Print " Hello, World!"

      Print(): This is a built-in Python function that outputs the specified message to the console.
"Hello, World!": This is a string, which is a sequence of characters. In Python, strings are enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes (").
      Parentheses (): These are used to call functions in Python. In this case, the print() function is called with the string "Hello, World!" as its argument.
  
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   - Ans : Here are the basic data types in Python:

Integers (int): Whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero, without a fractional part. Example: 1, -5, 0.

Floats (float): Decimal numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. Example: 3.14, -0.5, 0.0.

Strings (str): Sequences of characters, such as words, sentences, or phrases. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). Example: 'hello', "goodbye".

Boolean (bool): Values that can be either True or False.

List (list): Ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Lists are defined using square brackets [] and elements are separated by commas. Example: [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"].

Tuple (tuple): Ordered, immutable collections of items that can be of any data type. Tuples are defined using parentheses () and elements are separated by commas. Example: (1, 2, 3), ("a", "b", "c").

Here's a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:

# Integer
x = 5
print("x is an integer:", x)

# Float
y = 3.14
print("y is a float:", y)

# String
name = "John"
print("name is a string:", name)

# Boolean
is_admin = True
print("is_admin is a boolean:", is_admin)

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("fruits is a list:", fruits)

# Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print("colors is a tuple:", colors)

# Using variables
print("Hello, " + name + "! You have " + str(len(fruits)) + " fruits.")
print("Your favorite fruit is", fruits[0] + ".")
print("The first color is", colors[0] + ".")
This script creates variables of different data types, prints their values, and demonstrates how to use them in expressions and statements. The output will be:

x is an integer: 5
y is a float: 3.14
name is a string: John
is_admin is a boolean: True
fruits is a list: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
colors is a tuple: ('red', 'green', 'blue')
Hello, John! You have 3 fruits.
Your favorite fruit is apple.
The first color is red. 

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   - Ans :
       Conditional statements and loops are fundamental control flow structures in Python that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

   Examples : "if-else"
    x = 10
    if x < 5 :
      print ("x is less than 5") 
   else :
      print("x is greater than or equal to 5")

      Loops : 
Loops allow you to iterate over a sequence of values and execute a block of code for each value in the sequence. The most common loop in Python is the "for" loop.

      Example : "for" loop 
         fruits = ("apples", "guava", "orange", "cashew")
         for fruits in fruits :
            print(fruit)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   - Ans :
      In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to read, debug, and maintain. Functions can also accept input in the form of arguments, and return output in the form of a value.

Here's an example of a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
      
      Example : sum1.py 
      def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    This function takes two arguments and returns their sum.
    """
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum
      result = add_two_numbers(3, 5)
      print(result)  # Output: 8
      
     7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
    - Ans :
      Lists are ordered collections of values, enclosed in square brackets []. List elements can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, and other lists. Lists support a variety of operations, such as indexing, slicing, and appending.

   Dictionaries, on the other hand, are unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}. Dictionary keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries support operations such as adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.

Script:
List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary with some key-value pairs
my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Basic list operations
print("List elements:")
print(numbers)

print("\nList indexing:")
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1

print("\nList slicing:")
print(numbers[1:3])  # Output: [2, 3]

print("\nList appending:")
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Basic dictionary operations
print("\nDictionary keys and values:")
print(my_dict)

print("\nDictionary indexing (get value by key):")
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: Alice

print("\nDictionary updating:")
my_dict["age"] = 31
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}

print("\nDictionary deleting:")
del my_dict["city"]
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   - Ans :
     Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for handling errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. Instead of causing the program to crash, exceptions can be caught and handled gracefully, allowing the program to continue running or to provide helpful error messages to the user.

      Example : Exception Script(uses 'try', 'except',and 'finally')
   
    # Code that may raise an exception
    x = 1 / 0
      except ExceptionType as e:
    # Code that handles the exception
      print("An error occurred:", e)
finally:
    # Code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurred
    print("This code runs regardless of exceptions.")
   - 9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   - Ans :
      A module is a Python file that contains functions, classes and can contain other code.It can be imported and used in other python scripts. To create a module, simply create a new Python file and define your functions, classes, and variables as usual.

     A package is a way of organizing related modules into a single directory. A package can contain subdirectories, which can contain their own modules and subdirectories, allowing for complex hierarchical organization of code. 

     Here's an example of how to import and use the math module 

     Example : 
     import math

# Use the pi constant
print(math.pi)

# Use the sqrt function
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)

# Use the ceil function
result = math.ceil(3.14)
print(result)


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    - Ans :
          Python provides built-in functions for creating, writing, and reading files. Two types of files can be handled in Python, normal text files and binary files (written in binary language, 0s, and 1s).

      Text files: In this type of file, Each line of text is terminated with a special character called EOL (End of Line), which is the new line character (â€˜\nâ€™) in Python by default.
      Binary files: In this type of file, there is no terminator for a line, and the data is stored after converting it into machine-understandable binary language

      Example of script that reads and writes to a file :
      E.g (To read content of a file)
      with open("myfile.txt", "r") as f:
      content = f.read()
      print(content)

      E.g** (To write a list of strings to a file)

      my_list = ["Hello", "World", "from", "Python"]

      with open("myfile.txt", "w") as f:
      for item in my_list:
        f.write("%s\n" % item)
